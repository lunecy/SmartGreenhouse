		The Greenhouse is currently an essential part of the agricultural process across the 			globe. Such greenhouses require constant monitoring to maintain a healthy plant growth. 		For this purpose, the team is designing a miniature automated greenhouse which can be used
		for monitoring purposes. The project requires building a system which can monitor the
		ambient temperature, the soil moisture level and the concentration of carbon dioxide in
		the air. This report will present the progress regarding the design and implementation in
		Phase 2. The report also discusses the future plans for Phase 3 along with all the
		deviations that took place. Finally the CEAB graduate attributes are completed to 	the 			environmental impact of this system.
